Influship is a data-first influencer intelligence platform for modern brands. We help teams discover, evaluate, and activate creators using real-world signals - not self-reported bios, vanity metrics, or shallow filters.

At the core, we’re building the data layer for modern influencer marketing: large-scale creator discovery, signal extraction, and performance intelligence across platforms and formats. Our approach is grounded in turning messy, real-world creator data into structured, queryable signals that hold up in production.

Our technical interests span large-scale data extraction, MLOps, and multimodal AI across text, image, and video. We care deeply about precision, scalability, and long-term correctness.
